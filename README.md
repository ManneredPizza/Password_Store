# Password_Store

Goal of this project was to create a SQLite Database in which I can store my password.
I used some cryptography modules to encrypt my password, for security reason.
The password store in the DB are accessible only if the user knows the DB password, that is the key to decrypt the stored datas.
The programme is also capable to generate new passwords for new sites, using a mixture of letter from random words, some uppercase letters and some special sign.
I'm now working on some other features.
